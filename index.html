                            <p>Linux is a operating system kernel first released on September     17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. 
                                 Linux is pretty much the only open source operating system, requires no license , is a freely distributable, cross-platform operating system based on almost any electronic. Linux is fantastic for a lot of things, it can be a virtual machine. Linux is the basis of the raspberry PI computer and Deft and Debian are also operating  systems of of Linux. Kiol is also made of off Linux and is a very handy OS for hacking. People in 2nd and 3rd world countries and even schools use Linux because it’s easy access. You can share copies of the operating systems with other people legally. </p>

                            <p>Imagine a lightweight OS that is geared toward focusing on your web browser, as many computer users primarily use the web and hardly open their offline applications. By stripping most offline applications away, you get Chrome OS. Released by Google in 2009, Chrome OS is meant to be a fast, easy-to-use OS that is heavily reliant on the internet. If you’ve ever used the Chrome Web Browser, it’s practically the same experience with a few offline features. Chrome OS mainly runs on Chromebooks, for the most part low-cost laptops that provide an affordable way to access the web, while being able to handle web browsing and web apps with ease. Chromebooks have become quite popular with students and schools.</p>

                                <p>Android OS was first created by Andy Rubin, and was eventually bought by Google Inc. Since its consumer release in 2009, Android has transitioned from humble beginnings to the beautiful functioning behemoth it is today, as the most popular mobile OS in the world. If you like customization, powerful hardware for a fair price, or variety of choice, then Android is a great choice for your mobile phone. With Google as its owner, most Android devices are much more integrated with Google services than with any other OS. However, because Android devices are made with partnerships with Google and hardware manufactures, updates to the software can be delayed, causing fragmentation.</p>

However, iOS products are quite expensive, have a low range of options and hardly any software customization. Although very popular in North America and China, it’s not often found in developing countries.
