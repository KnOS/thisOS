                            <p>Linux is a operating system kernel first released on September     17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. 
                                 Linux is pretty much the only open source operating system, requires no license , is a freely distributable, cross-platform operating system based on almost any electronic. Linux is fantastic for a lot of things, it can be a virtual machine. Linux is the basis of the raspberry PI computer and Deft and Debian are also operating  systems of of Linux. Kiol is also made of off Linux and is a very handy OS for hacking. People in 2nd and 3rd world countries and even schools use Linux because it’s easy access. You can share copies of the operating systems with other people legally. </p>
